## Abstract

Data described by econometric models typically contains autocorrelation  and/or
heteroscedasticity of unknown form and for inference in such models it is
essential to use covariance matrix estimators that can consistently estimate the
covariance of the model parameters. Hence, suitable
heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) and heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation
consistent (HAC) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric
literature over the last 20 years. To apply these estimators in practice, an
implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of
the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools. In this paper,
such an implementation in the package _sandwich_ in the R system for statistical
computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide
reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they
can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications. The
toolbox contained in _sandwich_ is extremely flexible and comprehensive,
including specific functions for the most important HC and HAC estimators from
the econometric literature. Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate
how the functionality can be integrated into applications.
