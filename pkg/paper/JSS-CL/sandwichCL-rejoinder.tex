\author{Various Versatile Variances:\\ An Object-Oriented Implementation of Clustered Covariances in R}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Associate Editor}

\textbf{\textit{With respect to the reviewers' comments, Reviewer A states near the end of
the review that, ``I think the authors should make readers aware of
bootstrap-type alternatives to the analytical cluster-robust covariance
estimators (the 'wild bootstrap' etc.).'' In fact, in the simulations
reported in the paper, there is a comparison to the bootstrap (though
limited to the simple cluster-resampling bootstrap).}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{As well, I didn't find the material raised in Reviewer B's points 1, 6, 11,
and 14 to be unclear, although it wouldn't hurt to provide a bit more
explanation in these places.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{My own reading of the paper is largely consistent with the reviewers', and
I'd add that the paper and the improvements and extensions to the sandwich
package that it describes are an important contribution, both elegant in its
implementation and of substantial practical use.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{I found the simulations reported in section 6 slightly inappropriate to the
main purpose of the paper, which is to describe the implementation in the
sandwich package of coefficient-covariance estimators for clustered data.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{I also found a few typos in the manuscript: At several points in the paper,
e.g., on p.~7, ``subtract'' and ``subtracted'' are spelled ``substract'' and
``substracted.'' On p.~9, ``and and'' appears (the second ``and'' in italics). 
On p.~14, ``sandwich covariance are able'' should read ``sandwich covariances
are able.''}}

\medskip

Fixed.

\section*{Referee 1}

\textbf{\textit{Comparison with Stata (as requested by the editor):
\\
The comparison with Stata naturally separates into two parts: ``Official Stata'', i.e., the code provided by StataCorp when purchasing the software, and ``the Stata Community'', i.e., code provided by the user community at large and (mostly) residing at SSC Archives.}}

\medskip

Added a new subsection with a discussion of clustered covariances in Stata.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{Suggestions relating to the writeup:
\\
The writeup is fine as it is, but I think readers and users would benefit a lot from expanding the discussion to cover the limitations of, alternatives to, and history of the cluster-robust covariance estimation.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{Lastly, I think the authors should make readers aware of bootstrap-type alternatives to the analytical cluster-robust covariance estimators (the ``wild bootstrap'' etc.).}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{Suggestions relating to the code:
\\
The authors may want to consider incorporating the  covariance estimator of Kloek (1981, Econometrica; see the AAIW paper for a description and discussion) and/or Kiefer (1980).}}

\section*{Referee 2}

\textbf{\textit{1. In equation (2), the definition of the term ``$\psi'(y, x, \theta)$'' unclear.
I guess that this term should indicate $\partial \psi(y, x, \theta)/\partial\theta = \partial^2\Psi(y, x, \theta)/\partial\theta^2$ and I recommend to replace ``$\psi'(y, x, \theta)$''
by an expression that readers can easily understand
(e.g., ``$\partial \psi(y, x, \theta)/\partial\theta$'' or ``$\partial^2\Psi(y, x, \theta)/\partial\theta^2$").}}

\medskip

Term $\psi(y, x, \theta)$ is meant to be the first derivative of an objective function $\Psi(y, x, \theta)$ (typically the log-likelihood), with respect to a parameter vector $\theta$. As mentioned correctly by the referee, $\psi'(y, x, \theta)$ is the second derivative of the objective function $\Psi(y, x, \theta)$ with respect to $\theta$.

I replaced term $\psi'(y, x, \theta)$ by $\frac{\partial \psi(y, x, \theta)}{\partial\theta}$ in Equation (2) as well as in Equation (6).

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{2. The matrix defined in equation (5) is slightly unclear. I guess that the terms ``$\psi(y_i, x_i, \hat\theta)$'' ($i \in \{1, n\}$) in equation (5) indicate row-vectors. As vectors are usually assumed to be column-vectors (unless stated otherwise) and $\psi(y_i, x_i, \hat\theta)$ seem to be column-vectors in
equation (7), I recommend to add transformation signs to the two vectors in equation (5)
so that they become ``$\psi(y_i, x_i, \hat\theta)^\top$''.}}

\medskip

Fixed in Equation (5) as well as in Equation (11).

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{3. It seems to me that equation (12) is incorrect, because this equation is basically identical
to equation (7) and, thus, does not take into account clustering (as it simply takes the
sum over all observations). I guess that the correct equation is something like:
\begin{equation}
  \hat M_\mathrm{CL} \quad = \quad \frac{1}{n} \sum_{g = 1}^G\bigg(\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{g}}\psi(y_{ig}, x_{ig}, \hat \theta) \bigg) \bigg(\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{g}} \psi(y_{ig}, x_{ig}, \hat \theta) \bigg)^\top.
\end{equation}}}

\medskip

Fixed.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{4. The ``hat matrix H'' that is mentioned on page 6 is not defined in the manuscript. I
recommend that the authors define this matrix in the manuscript.}}

\medskip

The definition for the hat matrix $H$ has been included in the manuscript for the linear model.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{5. On page 7, several parts in the paragraph that starts with ``Petersen (2009)'' are unclear
to me. I recommend that the authors reformulate and perhaps extend this paragraph in
order to make it easier understandable.}}

\medskip

The paragraph has been fully reformulated, additionally augmented by an example and is now hopefully easier to understand:

Petersen (2009), Thompson (2011) and Ma (2014)
suggest to substract the standard sandwich estimator instead of $\hat M_{\mathrm{CL}(id \cap time)}$ in Equation (20) in case there is only a single
observation in each intersection of $id$ and $time$.
For example, when clustering by dimensions \emph{id} and \emph{year} in a sample
of \emph{id-month} observations, each cluster is composed of 12 observations (Ma, 2014). In such a setting, the last substracted matrix of Equation (20) should be the clustered covariance matrix  $\hat M_{\mathrm{CL}(id \cap year)}$
with clusters formed by the intersection of \emph{id} and \emph{year}.
As Ma (2014) argues, the standard sandwich estimator does not take into
account any type of bias adjustment (with an adjustment of $1$), in contrast to clustered covariance estimators (with an adjustment of $\frac{G}{G-1}$), hence the cluster bias correction  $\frac{G}{G-1} > 1$. If there is is only a singe observation in each intersection of $id$ and $time$, $\hat M_{\mathrm{CL}(id \cap time)}$ collapses to a standard sandwich estimator. Then, clustered covariances $\hat M_{\mathrm{CL}(id,time)}$ are underestimated when using $\hat M_{\mathrm{CL}(id \cap time)}$ instead of standard sandwich covariances as the last substracted matrix, because of the larger bias correction $\frac{G}{G-1} > 1$.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{6. It is not clear to me which of the approaches that are described in sections 3.3 and 3.4
of the manuscript (and that are implemented in the sandwich package) can deal with clustering of individuals in panel data sets, e.g., if the panel data set includes data from T time periods for n individuals that are ``clustered'' in G groups of individuals. Please clarify this in the manuscript.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{7. In equation (21), it is unclear to me how this approach takes into account the time
dimension of the panel data set (as none of the terms in this equation has a subscript t).
Furthermore, as subscripts i and j seem to indicate individuals (or observations?), it
seems to be weird that the ordering of the individuals (or of the observations) affects the
weights that account for ``correlation'' between each pair of individuals (or observations).
Please clarify this in the manuscript.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{8. In equation (22), similarly to equation (21), it seems to be weird that the ordering of
the individuals affects the weights that account for ``correlation'' between each pair of
individuals. Please clarify this in the manuscript.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{9. In section 3.4, the use of subscripts for individuals, groups, and time periods is confusing
and perhaps inconsistent. I recommend that the authors considerably revise and extend
this section so that it is less confusing and easier to understand.}}

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{10. On page 11, the closing parenthesis behind ``"NW1994"'' needs to be removed.}}

\medskip

Fixed.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{11. Equation (25) seems to be inconsistent with equations (29) and (30), because $\beta_1$ and
$\beta_2$ seem to be scalars in equation (25), while they seem to be vectors in equations (29)
and (30). This needs either to be corrected or -- if it is correct -- more clearly explained.}}

\medskip

Fixed.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{12. In Figures 1 and 2, the symbols for ``standard'' and ``basic'' (red and pink triangles)
as well as the symbols for ``random'' and ``gee'' (violet and red plus signs) look very
similar and cannot be easily distinguished from each other. I recommend to use clearly
different symbols (e.g., dark red triangle, orange up-side-down triangle, black plus sign,
grey asterisk).}}

\medskip

Changed the colors as well as symbols in Figures (1), (2), and (3) according to the recommendation.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{13. In the captions of Figures 1, 2, and 3, the meaning of the symbol ``$\rho$'' is unclear. Are
there typos and the ``$\rho$''s should be in fact ``$\rho_x$''s or do the ``$\rho$''s indicate something else?
This needs to be correct or explained.}}

\medskip

The cluster correlation for the regressors is controlled by parameter $\rho_x$. Note that the previously introduced cluster correlation for the response distributions is determined by yet another parameter $\rho$.

\medskip

\textbf{\textit{14. Several parts of the manuscript are not easily comprehensible for people who have limited
prior knowledge about ``sandwich'' methods and clustering in general. I highly recommend
that the authors revise and extend their explanations so that the manuscript can be more
easily understood by practitioners who want to apply the methods that are described in
the manuscript and are implemented in the sandwich package.}}
