A certain share of the criticism (of the associate editor and 
referee 1) is about the usefulness of sandwich covariance matrices.
The paper does not advocate the usage (let alone the routine
usage) of sandwich standard errors for all models - it does
merely provide the infrastructure to compute them easily in
an object-oriented way. Whether or not it is sensible to make
use of this infrastructure for a particular analysis problem
should be decided by the data analyst (not his/her software).
This is stated more clearly now in Section 1/2 and 6.

The existence of an objective function is not required for
deriving the sandwich estimators. Now, this is stated more clearly
in Section 2.

The history of CRAN releases of the sandwich package is available at
  http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/S/
The changes in the package since the release of the 2004 JSS paper
(sandwich 1.0-0) are documented in the NEWS file of the package and
the vignette currently under review for JSS.

Fixed.

Changed to "R user" and "R developer".

The name "useR" was probably coined by David Meyer in 2003 as the name
for the R User Conference "useR!" (see http://www.R-project.org/useR-2006/)
and is since frequently used in the R community.
