## Abstract

Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to
account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political
sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference
following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized
linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just
refer to ``the'' clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide
variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of
bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly
the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in
more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses).

In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been
somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably
the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented
approach to "robust" covariance matrix estimation - applicable beyond
`lm()` and `glm()` - is available in the _sandwich_ package but
has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with
_sandwich_ 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for
two generic functions (`estfun()` and `bread()`), clustered and panel
covariances are provided in `vcovCL()`, `vcovPL()`, and `vcovPC()`. 
Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in `vcovBS()`,
using model `update()` on bootstrap samples. These are directly
applicable to models from packages including _MASS_, _pscl_, _countreg_,
and _betareg_, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided
as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.
