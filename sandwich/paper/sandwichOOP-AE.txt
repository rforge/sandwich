I have only a few other comments:

1.  The implicit definition of thetahat, since he is assuming an
equivalent minimization problem. is a bit  nonstandard, I would
suggest conforming to the usual conventions and writing

        rho for Psi

and starting with

        thetahat = argmin sum rho(...)

and then  using \grad in (2) and more importantly in (5) and later.

2.  It is important to say early on that sandwiches rely on our
willing suspension of disbelief in the _bias_ resulting from  
misspecification.
A recent cautionary note on this topic is available here:

3.  Finally, I would like to question the central european choice
of the function name meat(), and suggest that he might consider
sprouts() as an alternative.
